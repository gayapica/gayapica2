	    <h1>In our code, we started with a base containing the ocean, a layer of sand, and some seaweed. After this, there's a fish that swims across the screen. A plastic bag then floats down and gets eaten by a sea turtle that's also swimming by. The consumption of the plastic kills the turtle. </h1>

    <h1>In our code, we added a galaxy base to set the space theme of the game. Then, we added aliens and rock turtles. Our idea was to have a timer and a score component. Along to this, the UFO can move around using keyboard control and the score increases when you “rescue," or collide with an alien. </h1>
